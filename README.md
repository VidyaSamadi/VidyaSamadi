### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ You are welcome to my Github page!
I am an Assistant Professor in the Agricultural Sciences Department @Clemson University. My focus is on applied engineering research, specifically on developing hydroinformatics tools and cyber-physical systems that best address water resources engineering simulation problems. I have an active research lab comprising students and lab members across multiple departments at Clemson University. I have active collaboration with hydroinformatics groups in the US and Europe where I mentor graduate students and collaborate on various research projects. We developed many tools and applications that their source codes are freely available at my Git account or at @ClemsonHHR Git account. I encourage you to look into our developed tools and if you are interested in collaborating and working with our team, please don't hesitate to contact me. 

 
âš¡ Fun fact &nbsp;
- A while ago, I started studying Computer Science at GeorgiaTech, but eventually couldn't move forward due to my full time job and personal issues! &nbsp;  
- I believe in gender diversity and inclusion in research and education because when groups of intelligent individuals are working to solve problems, the diversity of the problem solvers matters more than their individual ability. 
- We @HHRClemson have a Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) statement! We honor diverse perspectives, hold space for truly hearing and understanding each other, and harness our collective strengths to bring into the water resources research community that promote justice, equity, diversity, and inclusivity.
