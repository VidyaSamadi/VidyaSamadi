### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an Assistant Professor in the Agricultural Sciences Department @Clemson University. My focus is on applied engineering research, specifically on developing hydroinformatics tools and cyber-physical systems that best address water resources engineering simulation problems. I have an active research lab comprising students and lab members across multiple departments at Clemson University. I have active collaboration with hydroinformatics groups in the US and Europe where I mentor graduate students and collaborate on various research projects.  If you are interested in collaborating and working with our developer team, please contact me.
